# Economy of Motion

A wee platformer where you are restricted to under 13 keystrokes.
For js13k 2024, theme "TRISKAIDEKAPHOBIA".

I'm using a framework I wrote a few months ago, 
the original with more documentation is at https://github.com/aksommerville/weebpoc .
Everything is copied; no need to clone that repo to build this one.
