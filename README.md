# Economy of Motion

A wee platformer where you are restricted to under 13 keystrokes.
For js13k 2024, theme "TRISKAIDEKAPHOBIA".

I'm using a framework I wrote a few months ago, 
the original with more documentation is at https://github.com/aksommerville/weebpoc .
Everything is copied; no need to clone that repo to build this one.

## TODO

- [x] Graphics
- [x] Render bg, ladders, and motionless walls to an offscreen canvas just once per level.
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Hello splash
- [ ] Farewell splash
- [ ] Audio: Occassionally a too-loud note as it cancels. Hard to repro.
- [ ] Don't die when squashed, find another way to handle it. Possible to just kiss your toe against a platform and die because of it.
- [ ] Level editor
- [ ] Levels
- [ ] Experiment with PNG formats, maybe we can reduce size by using index instead of RGBA.
- [ ] Minicomic.
