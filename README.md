# Economy of Motion

A wee platformer where you are restricted to under 13 keystrokes.
For js13k 2024, theme "TRISKAIDEKAPHOBIA".

I'm using a framework I wrote a few months ago, 
the original with more documentation is at https://github.com/aksommerville/weebpoc .
Everything is copied; no need to clone that repo to build this one.

## TODO

- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Music -- Just refine the instruments and I think we're done.
- [ ] Hello splash
- [ ] Victory splash
- [x] Some display during death and win time. Added just "press jump" and I like it.
- [x] Show step count always?
- [ ] Audio: Occassionally a too-loud note as it cancels. Hard to repro.
- [x] Don't die when squashed, find another way to handle it. Possible to just kiss your toe against a platform and die because of it.
- [x] Levels
- [ ] Experiment with PNG formats, maybe we can reduce size by using index instead of RGBA.
- [ ] Minicomic.
- [ ] Draw the background more efficiently, it's embarrassing.
- [ ] Up and Down should only count when they do something, ie ladder.
- [ ] No need to include song or background color in stage; they are always the same.
- [ ] Ladder animation runs too fast when holding horz, must be using walk timing.
