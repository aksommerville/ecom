# Economy of Motion

A wee platformer where you are restricted to under 13 keystrokes.
For js13k 2024, theme "TRISKAIDEKAPHOBIA".

I'm using a framework I wrote a few months ago, 
the original with more documentation is at https://github.com/aksommerville/weebpoc .
Everything is copied; no need to clone that repo to build this one.

## TODO

- [ ] Maybe not Dust Devil for the main theme. We need something that gets to the point within like 5 seconds. Levels are short.
- [x] Victory splash
- [x] Experiment with PNG formats, maybe we can reduce size by using index instead of RGBA. ...no need
- [ ] Minicomic.
- [x] Draw the background more efficiently, it's embarrassing.
- [ ] Validate in major OS and browsers:
- - [ ] MacOS Chrome
- - [ ] MacOS Firefox
- - [ ] Windows Chrome
- - [ ] Windows Firefox
